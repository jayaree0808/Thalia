		<h1> Dear Thalia</h1>
		<p> I know you said that you felt as if you were a last option or something if I had asked late. But I'm telling you that you're not, You're not the last option at all. ❤️I just did not know how to ask you tbh. I sat and thought about the best way to do it, and I could not come up with anything. I'm using code to make this lol...putting my DM knowledge to use and I saw it on TikTok and thought you might find it cute or sumn... but without further delay...</p> <br>
